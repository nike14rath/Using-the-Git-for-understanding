Here, i am trying to learn the git.
Git is quite important for a coder.
So, i am actively learning it so that i can utilise it for sure in my future projects.



I thought i have made some changes here, but it feels like, it won't effect us too much.


Things always takes time to imporve so don't worry about that keep hardworking for better future.
how are you my friend
